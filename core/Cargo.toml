# Track Zero-A: SWA Transformer pipeline
# Pure Rust forward + backward with Enzyme AD for gradient computation.

# Fat LTO is MANDATORY for Enzyme.
# Enzyme operates at LLVM IR level and must see all function bodies
# in a single compilation unit. Without fat LTO, cross-module calls
# are opaque and Enzyme cannot differentiate through them.
